## Status Quo

- This is a static single-page web that just shows the frontpage
- To use it,  check it out `git clone git@github.com:minthemiddle/vp-website.git`
- Compile the sass file with `sass css/custom.scss:css/custom.css` (if you don't have sass installed, get it with `brew install sass` (Mac) or `sudo apt-get install ruby-sass`
- Right now you could even just open `index.html`, but it's more realistic to start a local server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and open `0.0.0.0:8000` in your browser.
